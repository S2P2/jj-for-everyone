# Cloning a remote

````admonish reset title="Reset your progress" collapsible=true
To reset your progress to the start of this chapter, run the following command:

```sh
curl https://jj-for-everyone.github.io/reset.sh | bash -s clone
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```
````

In order to drive home the point that the remote repository functions as a backup, we're now going to completely delete our main repository and restore it from the remote.
First, the deletion:

```sh
cd ~
rm -rf ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```

The next step is restoring the repo, but you can also think of it in a different way.
Imagine there is an ongoing project and you have just joined the team.
In order to contribute changes to the project, you first need to get a copy of it on your own computer.
The process to do that with Jujutsu is the exact same process as restoring the project from a backup remote.
Here's the command:

```sh
jj git clone ~/jj-tutorial/remote ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```

The last two arguments are (1) the **source** from which to clone and (2) the **destination** - where to store the copied repo. 
When you clone from a remote, you're automatically connected to it with the default name `origin`.

For the tutorial, we also need to recreate our repo-specific authorship configuration:

```sh
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
jj config set --repo user.name "Alice"
jj config set --repo user.email "alice@local"
jj metaedit --update-author
```

Let's run `jj log` in our fresh clone to see if we restored the repo successfully:

The most recent commit we made is visible, but its ancestors are hidden.
In their place is a tilde **`~`** symbol.
Jujutsu uses a rule to determine which commits you are probably not interesting to you.
These commits are hidden by default in the output of `jj log`.
We can tell Jujutsu to show us _all_ commits with `jj log --revisions 'all()'`:

All commits are here, so our repository was successfully restored from the remote.

```admonish success title="You've completed Level 1 ! ðŸŽ‰"
You made it!
At this point, you have all the skills needed for simple solo projects with proper backup.
If you're planning to use GitHub, the next chapter is an optional one with tips for that.

Let's summarize the workflow again:
1. make changes
1. create a new commit
1. move the bookmark
1. push to the remote

Ideally, you can take a little break now and practice what you've learned.
Once you feel comfortable with the above, come back quickly for level 2.
We're just scratching the surface.

If you need to collaborate with other people, level 2 is just as essential as this one.
I encourage you keep going right away!
