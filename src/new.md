# Creating a new commit

We have now added some changes and a description to a commit, that's 99% of your day-to-day VCS activities.
Let's say we want to make another change to the project which should belong to a different commit.
You can create a new one with the command `jj new` and see what happened with `jj log`:

There are a few things to observe here:
- The new commit is a child of our previous working copy commit.
- The new commit became our working copy, meaning any further file changes will be recorded into the new commit.
- The previous commit is marked with `git_head()`.
  This marker is not important and you can ignore it.
- The previous commit has a different symbol (circle) than the root commit (diamond).
  This is related to an important feature, but we'll learn about it later.
  TODO will we?

At this point, we've closed the cycle.
You make changes, give them a description and finish off by creating a new commit that descends from the one you just completed.
Rinse and repeat - that's our basic version-control workflow.

Let's complete a second commit to make the next section more interesting.
You can be creative or just copy these commands:

```sh
printf "\nThis is a toy repository for learning version control with Jujutsu.\n" >> README.md
jj describe -m "Add project description to readme"
jj new
```

There's a neat trick in these commands:
If you'd like to describe a commit with only a short message, you can do so by passing it to the `-m` flag of the `describe` command.
This can be faster than opening a separate text editor.

Let's check the state of our repo again:

This is starting to look like something!
