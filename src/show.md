# Inspecting a commit

````admonish reset title="Reset your progress" collapsible=true
To reset your progress, run this command and `cd` into the tutorial repository:
```sh
curl https://s2p2.github.io/jj-for-everyone/reset.sh | bash -s show
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```
````

Alice sees Bob also made changes. To check if they conflict with her own, she inspects his commit using `jj show` on the `main@origin` remote bookmark.

```sh
jj show main@origin
```

    Document hello.py in README.md

    The file hello.py doesn't exist yet, because Alice is working on that.
    Once our changes are combined, this documentation will be accurate.

The `jj show` command provides more detail than `jj log`:

*   **Commit and Change IDs**: Shows the full IDs, not just the short prefixes.
*   **Bookmarks**: Lists any bookmarks pointing to this commit.
*   **Author and Committer**: Includes full author/committer info and timestamps.
*   **Commit Message**: Displays the complete message, including the body.
*   **Diff**: Shows the precise file changes, with additions in <span class="green">green</span> and removals in <span class="red">red</span>.

````admonish note title="Author vs. Committer" collapsible=true
The **author** is who wrote the code. The **committer** is who created the commit. They are usually the same.

They can differ if one person applies a patch submitted by another. For example, to set a different author for the current commit, you can run:

```sh
jj describe --author "Claire <claire@local>" --no-edit
```

````

Alice confirms the changes are compatible: Bob only modified `README.md`, while she added `hello.py`. Now she can combine them.
