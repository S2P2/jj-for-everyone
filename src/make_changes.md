# Making changes

````admonish reset title="Reset your progress" collapsible=true
To reset your progress to the start of this chapter, run the following command:

```sh
curl https://s2p2.github.io/jj-for-everyone/reset.sh | bash -s make_changes
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```

Your primary goal is always to work on a project, Jujutsu just helps you manage your work.
So let's pretend we're doing some actual work by putting stuff in a file:

```sh
echo "# jj-tutorial" > README.md
```

When you change files in a directory tracked by Jujutsu, what you're conceptually doing is modifying the working copy commit.
Let's see what `jj log` has to say now:

</pre>

A couple of things have changed:
- The timestamp of the commit was updated.
- The commit hash changed.
  That's one of the reasons the commit hash is less interesting, it changes every time anything else in the commit changes.
- The commit is not "(empty)" anymore!

The last point means that our new file was successfully recorded in the working copy commit.
