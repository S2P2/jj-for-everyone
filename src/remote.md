# Sending commits to a remote

````admonish reset title="Reset your progress" collapsible=true
To reset your progress to the start of this chapter, run the following command:

```sh
curl https://s2p2.github.io/jj-for-everyone/reset.sh | bash -s remote
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```
````

Your commits are stored locally, which means they are not backed up. To back up your work and collaborate with others, you can send your commits to a **remote**.

While services like [GitHub](https://github.com/) are common, this tutorial uses a simple local directory as a remote for learning purposes. This method is not suitable for real-world backups or collaboration but is perfect for understanding the mechanics.

## Initialize the Remote

First, create a "bare" Git repository to serve as the remote. A bare repository contains only version history, with no working copy of the files.

```sh
git init --bare -b main ~/jj-tutorial/remote
```

````admonish note title="The difference between remote (bare) and regular repositories" collapsible=true
A regular Jujutsu repository has two parts: (1) the internal database (`.git` and `.jj` directories) and (2) the **working copy** of your files that you can edit.

A "bare" repository is a Git repository **without a working copy**. Since we only use the remote for sending and receiving commits, a working copy isn't needed. The `-b main` flag sets the default branch name to "main".
````

## Connect to the Remote

Next, connect your local repository to the remote. By convention, the primary remote is named **origin**.

```sh
jj git remote add origin ~/jj-tutorial/remote
```

For a service like GitHub, you would use a URL instead of a local path. Verify the remote was added:

```sh
jj git remote list
```

## Add a Bookmark

To push a commit, you must first attach a **bookmark** to it. Bookmarks are named labels that mark important commits to be kept on the remote.

Let's create a bookmark called **main**, a common convention for the project's primary state, and point it to your commit.

```sh
jj bookmark create main --revision mkmqlnox # <- substitute your change ID here
```

The command `jj bookmark create` expects a name (`main`) and a commit to which the bookmark should point.
We identify the commit by its change ID (`--revision mkmqlnox`).
The flag `--revision` can also be abbreviated as `-r`.
Let's check the result with `jj log`:

</pre>

The output shows the `main` bookmark pointing to your commit.

## Track a bookmark

We are now learning about bookmarks because we want to send commits to a remote.
However, bookmarks can also be used for local-only purposes. You may not want to send _all_ of your bookmarks to a remote.

Jujutsu identifies bookmarks which are supposed to be sent to a remote with a "tracking" state.
In order to send the `main` bookmark to our remote, we need to "track it" first:

```sh
jj bookmark track main@origin
```

The `@origin` part means that `main` should be sent to the remote called `origin`.

## Push the bookmark

Now that we're connected and have a tracked bookmark, let's finally send our commit to the remote. The technical term for sending commits is "pushing" them.

```sh
jj git push --bookmark main
```
