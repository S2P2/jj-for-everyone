# Inspecting the state of a repository

So, now we've got an empty repository.
Let's take a closer look at it.
The command `jj log` shows you a visual representation of your version history.
If you run it, you should see something like this:

<!-- generated by aha script -->
<pre class="aha">
<span class="bold "></span><span class="bold green ">@</span>  <span class="bold "></span><span class="bold purple ">r</span><span class="bold dimgray ">nyzwzlp</span><span class="bold "> </span><span class="bold yellow ">remo@buenzli.dev</span><span class="bold "> </span><span class="bold cyan ">2025-07-10 08:52:16</span><span class="bold "> </span><span class="bold blue ">b</span><span class="bold dimgray ">4cfe153</span><span class="bold "></span>
│  <span class="bold "></span><span class="bold green ">(empty)</span><span class="bold "> </span><span class="bold green ">(no description set)</span><span class="bold "></span>
<span class="bold "></span><span class="bold cyan ">◆</span> <span class="bold "></span><span class="bold purple ">z</span><span class="dimgray ">zzzzzzz</span> <span class="green ">root()</span> <span class="bold "></span><span class="bold blue ">0</span><span class="dimgray ">0000000</span>
</pre>

There's a lot going on already, so let's unpack it one-by-one.
In the leftmost column, there's an `@`, a line and a diamond.
The `@` sign represents the present state of the files in the repository, also known as the "working copy".
The diamond indicates an earlier state and the line connecting them means one state descends from another.
Older state are at the bottom and more recent ones are at the top.
In this case, the diamond is the "root", an empty state from which all others descend.
It always exists and cannot be modified.

Allow me to introduce a little bit of VCS-lingo.
Until now, I've used the word "state" to refer to the "working copy" (`@` sign) and the "root" (diamond).
These states are snapshots of your repository, storing all files in the repo and their content.
The technical term for these snapshots is **commit**.
The commit is the most important data structure in the repository and I will use that term from now on.

So what's going on to the right of the first column?
That's all important metadata about your commits.
Let's look at the one of the working copy commit:

<pre class="aha">
<span class="bold "></span><span class="bold purple ">r</span><span class="bold dimgray ">nyzwzlp</span><span class="bold "> </span><span class="bold yellow ">remo@buenzli.dev</span><span class="bold "> </span><span class="bold cyan ">2025-07-10 08:52:16</span><span class="bold "> </span><span class="bold blue ">b</span><span class="bold dimgray ">4cfe153</span><span class="bold "></span>
<span class="bold "></span><span class="bold green ">(empty)</span><span class="bold "> </span><span class="bold green ">(no description set)</span><span class="bold "></span>
</pre>

The first word is `rnyzwzlp`, a random-looking identification number called the **change ID**.
Next is the email address you previously configured, indicating that you are the author of this commit.
After that is a timestamp, indicating when the commit was created.
Last on the first line is another random looking word `b4cfe153`.
It's also an identification number, but this one is called the **commit hash** or commit ID.
The change ID is more important than the commit hash, which is reflected in their position in the log output: the important one comes first.
We'll discuss the purpose of these IDs in more detail later.

On the second line, the word "(empty)" indicates that none of the files in this commit were changed compared to the previous commit.
Lastly, "(no description set)" is self-explanatory and foreshadows the possibility of giving descriptions to commits.

Even though the repository is empty at this point, we already get a decent understanding of what a repository is.
It consist of a set of **commits** which are related to each other, where one commit is said to be the **parent** or the **child** of another.
These commits store snapshots of the state of your files, as well as relevant metadata like authorship, timestamp and description.
