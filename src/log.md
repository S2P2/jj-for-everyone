# Inspecting the state of a repository

````admonish reset title="Reset your progress" collapsible=true
To reset your progress to the start of this chapter, run the following command:

```sh
curl https://jj-for-everyone.github.io/reset.sh | bash -s log
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```
````

Now that you have an empty repository, let's inspect it with `jj log`, which shows a visual history of your work.

Let's break down this output. The history graph is on the left:

*   The `@` symbol represents your **working copy**, which is the current state of your files.
*   The `◆` symbol represents the **root commit**, an immutable empty state that all other commits descend from.
*   The line connects the two, showing that the working copy is a child of the root commit. History flows from bottom (oldest) to top (newest).

Each of these snapshots of your repository is called a **commit**. To the right of the graph is metadata about each commit. Let's look at the working copy commit:

<!-- generated by aha script -->
<pre class="aha">
<span class="bold "></span><span class="bold highlighted purple ">m</span><span class="bold highlighted dimgray ">kmqlnox</span><span class="bold "> </span><span class="bold yellow ">alice@local</span><span class="bold "> </span><span class="bold highlighted cyan ">2025-07-22 20:15:56</span><span class="bold "> </span><span class="bold highlighted blue ">f</span><span class="bold highlighted dimgray ">6feaadf</span><span class="bold "></span>
<span class="bold "></span><span class="bold highlighted green ">(empty)</span><span class="bold "> </span><span class="bold highlighted green ">(no description set)</span><span class="bold "></span>
</pre>

Here is what the different parts mean:

*   `mkmqlnox`: The **Change ID**, which identifies a conceptual change.
*   `alice@local`: The author of the commit.
*   `2025-07-22...`: The timestamp for when the commit was created.
*   `f6feaadf`: The **Commit ID** (or hash), which identifies this specific snapshot.
*   `(empty)`: No files were changed in this commit compared to its parent.
*   `(no description set)`: This commit does not have a description yet.

Note that the Change IDs, Commit IDs, and timestamps in my examples will likely differ from what you see. This is normal.

In short, a repository is a set of **commits**. Each commit is a snapshot of your files with associated metadata like an author, timestamp, and description. Commits are linked in a parent-child relationship to form a history.

## Getting help about using Jujutsu

We've now used `jj git init` and `jj log`. To explore Jujutsu's commands on your own, you can pass the `--help` flag.

*   `jj --help` lists all available commands.
*   `jj log --help` shows detailed documentation and options specifically for the `log` command.

The help pages can be dense, but they are an excellent resource for learning and problem-solving.
