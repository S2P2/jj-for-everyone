# Making changes

Your primary goal is always to work on a project, Jujutsu just helps you manage your work.
So let's pretend we're doing some actual work by putting stuff in a file:

```sh
echo "# jj-tutorial" > README.md
```

When you change files in a directory tracked by Jujutsu, what you're conceptually doing is modifying the working copy commit.
Let's see what `jj log` has to say now:

<pre class="aha">

│  <span class="bold "></span><span class="bold yellow ">(no description set)</span><span class="bold "></span>
<span class="bold "></span><span class="bold cyan ">◆</span>  <span class="bold "></span><span class="bold purple ">z</span><span class="dimgray ">zzzzzzz</span> <span class="green ">root()</span> <span class="bold "></span><span class="bold blue ">0</span><span class="dimgray ">0000000</span>
</pre>

A couple of things have changed:
- The timestamp of the commit was updated.
- The commit hash changed.
  That's one of the reasons the commit hash is less interesting, it changes every time anything else in the commit changes.
- The commit is not "(empty)" anymore!

The last point means that our new file was successfully recorded in the working copy commit.
