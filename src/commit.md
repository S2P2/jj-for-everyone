# Creating a new commit

````admonish reset title="Reset your progress" collapsible=true
To reset your progress to the start of this chapter, run the following command:

```sh
curl https://jj-for-everyone.github.io/reset.sh | bash -s commit
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```
````

When you're done with a set of changes, use `jj commit` to finalize them and start on a new task.

This command does two things:
1.  It opens a text editor for you to describe the commit you were just working on (`@`).
2.  It creates a new, empty working-copy commit for your next changes.

```sh
jj commit
```

```admonish note title="Note for Git Users" collapsible=true
 Unlike `git commit`, which bundles changes into a *new* commit, `jj commit` adds a description to the *existing* working-copy commit and then creates a new empty one.
```

#### Writing a Good Commit Message

In the editor, write a description for your changes.
*   **Subject:** The first line should be a short summary (ideally under 50 characters) in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add user authentication" not "Added user authentication").
*   **Body:** After a blank line, you can add a more detailed explanation of the *what* and *why* behind your changes. Keep lines under 72 characters.
*   **Comments:** Lines starting with `JJ:` are helpful notes about your changes and are automatically removed from the final description.

Example:
```
Add readme with project title

It's common practice for software projects to include a README.md file
in their root directory.
```

#### The Result

After saving and closing the editor, `jj log` will show your previous commit with its new description, and a new empty commit (`@`) ready for your next changes.

This establishes the basic workflow for version control:
1.  Make some changes.
2.  Create a new commit
