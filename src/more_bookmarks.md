# Adding more bookmarks

````admonish reset title="Reset your progress" collapsible=true
To reset your progress to the start of this chapter, run the following command:

```sh
curl https://jj-for-everyone.github.io/reset.sh | bash -s more_bookmarks
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```
````

Let's switch back to Alice:

```sh
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```

Alice attempts to get ahead by adding a loop to the program:

```sh
echo 'for (i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1):
    print("Hello, world!")' > hello.py
```

Unfortunately, running `python hello.py` prints an error:

```
  File "/home/user/jj-tutorial/repo/hello.py", line 1
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1):
         ^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Maybe you meant '==' or ':=' instead of '='?
```

She wants to save this experiment for later reference without breaking `main`. First, she commits:

```sh
jj commit -m "WIP: Add for loop (need to fix syntax)"
```

Pushing this work-in-progress (WIP) commit to `main` would be a mistake. The main bookmark should always point to stable, working code. Anyone else pulling from main would get her broken code, potentially blocking their work or getting it accidentally included in a project submission.

To share her experiment safely, she can push it to a separate bookmark. While she could name it manually (e.g., `alice/add-for-loop`), she can also let Jujutsu generate a name and push immediately:

```sh
jj git push --change @-
```

Jujutsu generated the bookmark `push-blabla` using the change ID.

**Note:** You can abbreviate `--change` as `-c`. Use `jj git push --help` to see more available flags.

Alice's experiment is now safely stored on the remote without interfering with `main`.
