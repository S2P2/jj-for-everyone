# Adding more bookmarks

````admonish quote title="Reset your progress" collapsible=true
To reset your progress to the start of this chapter, run the following command:

```sh
curl https://jj-for-everyone.github.io/reset.sh | bash -s more_bookmarks
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```
````

Let's switch back to Alice:

```sh
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```

She heard rumors that next week's assignment is going to be about writing loops in Python.
In an attempt to stay ahead of the game, she extends the hello-world program with iteration:

```sh
echo "for (i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1):
    print('Hello, world!')" > hello.py
```

Unfortunately, she seems to have made a mistake.
Running `python hello.py` prints an error:

```
  File "/home/user/jj-tutorial/repo/hello.py", line 1
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1):
         ^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Maybe you meant '==' or ':=' instead of '='?
```

Alice doesn't have time to figure out the problem.
She decides it's best to wait for the teacher to explain how to do it correctly in next week's lecture.
She doesn't just want to throw her changes away though.
She wants to keep the experiment around so she can compare it to the correct version later.
As usual, she creates a new commit before pushing:

```sh
jj commit -m "WIP: Add for loop (need to fix syntax)"
```

Pushing work-in-progress (WIP) changes like this directly to the main bookmark would be a bad idea.
Imagine if Bob later created a submission tarball and it accidentally included Alice's incomplete, incorrect code!
That would be no good.
To avoid that, Alice decides to push her commit to a new bookmark.

What should be the name of that bookmark?
Having a `main` bookmark is a strong convention, but for additional ones, anything goes.
A simple approach is to just use a super short description of your changes, like `add-for-loop`.
Some people like to prefix their bookmark names with their own name or username, allowing everyone to easily identify who's working on what: `alice/add-for-loop`.
Still others include a ticket number from their bug-tracker software in the bookmark name.
These are all fine options, but sometimes you _just don't care_.
Jujutsu has a handy way to push changes quickly by generating a bookmark name for you:

```sh
jj git push --change @-
```

The name of the generated bookmark is `push-`, followed by a prefix of the change ID.
It's not very informative, but that's kind of the point.
The content of the commit is what's important, the bookmark is only needed to send it to the remote.

Note that the `--change` flag can be abbreviated as `-c`.
You might be noticing a pattern here, many commonly-used flags have these short versions.
You can explore the available flags of any Jujutsu command by calling it with the `--help` flag, e.g. `jj git push --help`.

Alice's experiment with Python loops is now safely stored on the remote with a bookmark, but it doesn't interfere with unrelated work progressing on the main branch.
Great!
