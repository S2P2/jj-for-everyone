# Short-lived bookmarks

Now you have the basic skills to collaborate on projects with other people.
Let's summarize what we've learned:
- A branching history is normal when multiple people work together.
- You can combine changes from a branched history by creating a **merge** commit or by **rebasing** one branch of commits on another.
- Files which do not belong in version control can be excluded with `.gitignore` and\
  `jj file untrack`.
- Work-in-progress changes can be stored on the remote with short-lived bookmarks, until they're ready for inclusion in the main bookmark.

It's time to take a break and practice what you've learned.
I still recommend to come back for level 2 relatively soon.
It will teach you how to solve everyday problems like conflict resolution.
