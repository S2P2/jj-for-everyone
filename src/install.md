# Installation and setup

The best installation method depends on your system.
Please consult the [official installation instructions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup/) and then come back here.
If you just want to quickly download a binary, you can do so on the [release page](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/releases/latest).

You should tell Jujutsu who you are, so it can track the author of each change.

```sh
jj config set --user user.name "Firstname Lastname"
jj config set --user user.email "email.address@provider.com"
```

If you want shell completions, follow the instructions [here](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/install-and-setup/#command-line-completion).
If you don't know what a "shell completion" is, don't worry, it's not important.
