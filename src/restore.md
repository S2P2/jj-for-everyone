# Restoring file contents

````admonish reset title="Reset your progress" collapsible=true
To reset your progress to the start of this chapter, run the following command:

```sh
curl https://s2p2.github.io/jj-for-everyone/reset.sh | bash -s restore
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```
````

If you accidentally delete a file and make other changes before realizing it, `jj restore` can help.

For instance, Alice deletes `README.md` and then modifies `hello.py`:

```sh
rm README.md
echo '    print("In soviet Russia, world greets you!")' >> hello.py
jj show
```

To restore just `README.md` without losing other changes, run:

```sh
jj restore README.md
```

`jj restore` can also revert a file to its state in **any commit** using the `--from` flag. For example, to revert `hello.py` to a version with no translations:

```sh
jj restore --from 'description("Fix loop syntax")' hello.py
```

<span class="red ">   4</span>     : <span class="red ">    print("Bonjour, le monde!")</span>

After making changes, commit and push them:
```sh
jj commit -m "Remove translations"
jj bookmark move main --to @-
jj git push
```

```admonish success title="You've completed Level 3 ! ðŸŽ‰"
You now have the skills to handle most version control problems. Here's a summary of what you've learned:

- `jj undo`: Reverts your repository to a previous state, letting you experiment without fear.
- `jj bookmark track`: Lets you work on bookmarks that only exist on the remote.
- Merge Conflicts: Resolve by editing the marked files to combine the changes.
- `jj abandon`: Deletes commits you no longer need.
- `jj restore`: Restores file contents. By default, it reverts to the parent commit, but you can use `--from` to specify any commit.

You're now equipped for most daily tasks. The next level covers rewriting historyâ€”a powerful skill for creating a clean and professional commit history.

Feel free to practice these new skills before continuing. To learn more, explore commands with `--help` and consult the [configuration guide](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/config/).
