# Updating bookmarks

````admonish reset title="Reset your progress" collapsible=true
To reset your progress to the start of this chapter, run the following command:

```sh
curl https://jj-for-everyone.github.io/reset.sh | bash -s update_bookmark
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```

We have learned how to push a new bookmark to a remote for the first time.
We _could_ do that for every single commit we create and want to push to the remote.
However, that would lead to a lot of unnecessary bookmarks lying around.
A real mess!

Thankfully, there's a better way.
Instead of creating a new bookmark every time, we can **move** an existing bookmark so it points to another commit.

To try it out, we first need to create a new commit.
You can just copy these commands:

```sh
printf "\nThis is a toy repository for learning Jujutsu.\n" >> README.md
jj commit -m "Add project description to readme"
```

The above command uses a neat trick.
If you already have a short description in mind, you can pass it directly to `jj commit` with the `-m` flag (short for `--message`).
This can be faster than opening a separate text editor.

`jj log` shows us a new commit on top of the one we pushed to the remote:

Now we can send this new commit to the remote by first pointing the bookmark at it and then pushing the bookmark again.
Let's start by moving the bookmark:

```sh
jj bookmark move main --to @-
```

We could've told Jujutsu where to move the bookmark using the change ID, i.e. `--to kxqyrwux`.
Alternatively, we can use `@-`, which is a neat way to refer to the **parent of the working copy commit**.
There are many such clever ways to refer to commits, but that's a topic for later.
For now, just remember `@-`, because that's by far the most useful one.

Let's see what `jj log` has to say:

<!-- generated by aha script -->
<pre class="aha">
<span class="bold "></span><span class="bold green ">@</span>  <span class="bold "></span><span class="bold highlighted purple ">z</span><span class="bold highlighted dimgray ">zywylnt</span><span class="bold "> </span><span class="bold yellow ">alice@local</span><span class="bold "> </span><span class="bold highlighted cyan ">2025-07-22 20:36:38</span><span class="bold "> </span><span class="bold highlighted blue ">4</span><span class="bold highlighted dimgray ">8708b9f</span><span class="bold "></span>

○  <span class="bold "></span><span class="bold purple ">k</span><span class="highlighted dimgray ">xqyrwux</span> <span class="yellow ">alice@local</span> <span class="cyan ">2025-07-22 20:36:38</span> <span class="purple ">main*</span> <span class="green ">git_head()</span> <span class="bold "></span><span class="bold blue ">6</span><span class="highlighted dimgray ">ca38e90</span>

<span class="bold "></span><span class="bold highlighted cyan ">◆</span>  <span class="bold "></span><span class="bold purple ">m</span><span class="highlighted dimgray ">kmqlnox</span> <span class="yellow ">alice@local</span> <span class="cyan ">2025-07-22 20:25:40</span> <span class="purple ">main@origin</span> <span class="bold "></span><span class="bold blue ">7</span><span class="highlighted dimgray ">939d4cf</span>
│  Add readme with project title

</pre>

The important thing to notice here is that Jujutsu shows us the discrepancy between the local bookmark `main` and its remote counterpart.
`main*` is the local bookmark and the star next to the name means it's out-of-sync with the remote.
`main@origin` is the location of the bookmark on the remote.

We can fix the situation by pushing the bookmark again:

```sh
jj git push
```

This time, we didn't specify `--bookmark main` explicitly.
If you omit the `--bookmark` flag on the `push` command, Jujutsu tries to be smart about which bookmarks you actually want to push.
That usually works quite well.
If you think it didn't work, just try again with the `--bookmark` flag.

You might be wondering:
Since the remote requires a bookmark to receive commits and the `main` bookmark is **not** pointing to the first commit anymore... is that commit now lost or deleted?
Luckily it is not.
Commits store a reference to their parent commit, which is why Jujutsu knows the order in which to draw the commits in the output of `jj log`.
These references form a chain that protects all ancestors of a bookmarked commit from being lost.
