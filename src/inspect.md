# Inspecting the working copy

Let's create a second commit to make the following section more interesting.
Copy the following commands:

```sh
printf "\nThis is a toy repository for learning Jujutsu.\n" >> README.md
jj describe -m "Add projcet description to readme"
```

There's a neat trick in these commands:
If you'd like to describe a commit with only a short message, you can do so by passing it to the `-m` flag of the `describe` command.
This can be faster than opening a separate text editor.

We have again made some changes and added a description.
We could complete the commit by running `jj new` immediately.
However, let's double check that we didn't make a mistake and the commit is truly worthy of being **committed** to history.
We can inspect the content of the working copy with `jj show`:

<!-- generated by aha script -->
<pre class="aha">
Commit ID: <span class="blue ">57295e78f3bd106cc28aa261abb38b54aca5ae58</span>

    Add projcet description to readme

<span class="yellow ">Modified regular file README.md:</span>
<span class="red ">   1</span> <span class="green ">   1</span>: # jj-tutorial
     <span class="green ">   2</span>: <span class="underline "></span><span class="underline green "></span><span class="green "></span>
     <span class="green ">   3</span>: <span class="underline "></span><span class="underline green ">This is a toy repository for learning Jujutsu.</span><span class="green "></span>
</pre>

This provides more information about a single commit than `jj log`, which only shows what commits there are and their relationships.
Let's summarize what we see here:
- The first two lines are the commit ID and change ID.
  We've seen them already, but these ones are longer!
  That's because the output of `jj log` only shows you a **prefix** of the full ID.
  The prefix is usually enough to uniquely identify a commit, but sometimes you want the whole thing.
- The following two lines are the author and committer, as well as their timestamps.
  Author and committer are usually the same, there's no need to worry about the difference.
- Then there's the commit description.
- Lastly, we see a list of files that have changed in this commit as well as the precise changes of their contents.
  The color green means "added", so we know this commit added the third line in the file `README.md`.
  The first line is white, indicating that it was not changed in this commit.
  It's not visible here, but removed lines will be highlighted in red.

Oops!
Did you spot the mistake?
There's a typo in the commit description...
Let's try again:

```sh
jj describe -m "Add project description to readme"
```

Great, the description should be typo-free now.
It's a good idea to double check the state of your working copy before creating a new commit.
Don't worry too much though, it's not difficult to fix mistakes afterwards.
However, learning about that is part of level 1.
While you're studying level 0, it's best not to make mistakes in the first place.

Let's complete our second commit with `jj new` and check the state of our repo again:

This is starting to look like something!
