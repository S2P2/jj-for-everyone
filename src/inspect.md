# Inspecting a commit

Alice has just found out that Bod made changes at the same time as she did.
Before she attempts to somehow create a version that includes both changes, she wants to verify the two changes are compatible.
She therefore decides to check out Bob's changes by using `jj show`.
Since the remote bookmark `main` is pointing there, she can use that as identification.

```
jj show main@origin
```

    Document hello.py in README.md

    The file hello.py doesn't exist yet, because Alice is working on that.
    Once our changes are combined, this documentation will be accurate.

There's a lot of useful information here that `jj log` doesn't show.
Let's go over it one-by-one:
- The first two lines are the commit ID and change ID.
  We've seen them already, but these ones are longer!
  That's because the output of `jj log` only shows you a **prefix** of the full ID.
  The short prefix is usually enough to uniquely identify a commit, but sometimes you want the whole thing.
- Next is a list of bookmarks pointing to the commit.
- The following two lines are the author and committer, as well as their timestamps.
  Author and committer are usually the same, but not in this case.
  We specifically set the author to Bob when we described the commit with the flag `--author`.
  Our motivation was role play, but another one could be this:
  A peer sends you some code they wrote via email or [pigeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homing_pigeon).
  You would like to store that code in a repository, but you don't want to pretend to be the author.
  In that situation, the distinction between author and committer makes sense.
  One person wrote the code, the other person created the commit.
- Then there's the commit description.
  Notice that we see the full description here including its body.
  `jj log` only displays the subject line to save space.
- Lastly, we see a list of files that have changed in this commit as well as the precise changes of their content.
  The color green means "added" and red means "removed"
  So we can see that this commit removed the previous line 3 and replaced it with three new lines.
  The first line is white, indicating that it was not changed in this commit.

Alice is pretty sure that Bob's changes are compatible with hers.
He only changed the file `README.md`, while Alice didn't do anything besides adding `hello.py`.
Her next task is to create a version of the project that combines both changes.
