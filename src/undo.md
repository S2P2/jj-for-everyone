# Undoing mistakes

````admonish reset title="Reset your progress" collapsible=true
To reset your progress to the start of this chapter, run the following command:

```sh
curl https://jj-for-everyone.github.io/reset.sh | bash -s undo
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```
````

What we've learned so far can go a long way - until something goes wrong.
For example, assume you ran `jj commit` and hastily entered a sloppy commit message.
Now you'd like to go back and improve it.

With our current skill set, it's impossible to edit the description of a commit after we ran `jj commit`.
But what if we could simply **undo** a change we made to the repository?
Travel back in time?
Turns out we can, because Jujutsu stores not only a version history of our project in the form of commits, but it also keeps a log of all operations that were performed on the repository itself.
There are some low-level commands to inspect this "operation log" and restore the repository to a specific state in time.
For now though, I will only teach you about the high-level commands to undo and redo operations one-by-one.

```admonish warning title="This chapter requires at least Jujutsu version 0.33"
The commands we're going to run behave slightly differently with older versions.
If you have an older one (check with `jj --version`), please update to a more recent version before continuing.
```

Let's remind ourselves what the state of our repo looks like

```sh
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
jj log
```

## Making a mistake

Let's change something, so we can create a commit with a sloppy description.
Why not greet the world in a few more languages:

```sh
echo "print('Hallo, Welt!')" >> hello.py
echo "print('Bonjour, le monde!')" >> hello.py
```

Now let's create that commit with a bad description:

```sh
jj commit -m "code improvements"
```

## Undoing the mistake

Realizing our mistake, we'd like to fix it now.
We can restore the state of our repository to a previous point by running:

```sh
jj undo
```

Great!
We're back to the state before we wrote the bad commit message.
Now we get a second chance to write a better one:

```sh
jj commit -m "Print German and French greetings as well"
```

## Going further back

What happens if you make a mistake, then you do something else, and only later you realize your mistakes?
Can you undo multiple operations?
Sure you can!
It works exactly like the "undo" feature of typical graphical applications (which you may be used to using by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd>).
Every time you run `jj undo`, you take one step further into the past.
Let's try it a couple of times:

```sh
jj undo
```

One interesting thing to notice here is that Jujutsu registered your file modifications as a separate operation.
Every `jj` command you run will first check your filesystem if you made any modifications.
If you did, that will be recorded as a separate operation (called a "snapshot"), _before_ the one that corresponds to the actual command you ran.

Now, that was a good illustration, but the three operations we just undid weren't actually mistakes.
Can we get them back?
In a typical graphical application, you might do that by clicking on a "redo" button or by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Z</kbd>.
With Jujutsu, you run the command `jj redo`.
Let's do it three times to get back to our most recent state:

```sh
jj redo
jj redo
jj redo
```

If you were to run `jj redo` one more time, you'd get an error message telling you there's nothing to redo.

## Overwriting undone states

Remember the bad commit message we wrote?
It was "code improvements".
We'll, it's now impossible to get that commit back with only `jj undo` and `jj redo`.
If you create new states after having undone some others, those "undone" states will become "hidden".
This is exactly how the "undo" feature of typical graphical applications works, so you may not be surprised by this.

Unlike graphical applications, Jujutsu has more advanced commands to get even those states back.
That's a topic for another day though.

## Pushes to the remote can't be undone

Sending commits to the remote by pushing a bookmark is technically a normal operation on the repository.
Undoing such operations is almost always a bad idea though.
It doesn't tell the remote to restore its previous state, the remote is left intact.
The only thing `jj undo` does in that situation is _forget that commits were pushed to the remote_.
This can lead to pretty nasty errors the next time you try to fetch from or push to the remote.

The most frequent errors that can happen include "conflicted bookmarks" and "divergent change IDs".
Both of these problems can be solved, but now's not the right time for me to teach you _how_.
So, take my advice and _just don't do that_.

If you accidentally undid a `jj git push` operation, just `jj redo` it and you should be fine.

In the future, `jj undo` may outright refuse to undo operations that interacted with the remote.

## Repository history is not backed up to the remote

Deleting a repository locally is not a big deal if you have a remote.
Just clone the repo again and you'll have all of your commit history back.
However, that's not the case for the history of operations you made on the repository.
That history is local only.
So, `jj undo` works at most as far back as the state of when you cloned the repo.
